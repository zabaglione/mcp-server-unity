# Enhanced Compilation Error Detection

The Unity MCP Server now includes an enhanced compilation service that provides more reliable error detection by using multiple methods to find compilation errors.

## Features

The EnhancedCompilationService uses four different methods to detect errors:

1. **CompilationHelper Results** - Reads Unity's compilation results JSON file
2. **Compiler Output Files** - Parses Unity's temporary compiler output files
3. **Editor.log Parsing** - Enhanced parsing of the Unity Editor log
4. **Bee Compiler Output** - For Unity 2022.2+, reads the Bee build system's diagnostics

## Usage

### Enable Enhanced Compilation Service

Set the environment variable before starting the server:

```bash
export USE_ENHANCED_COMPILATION=true
npm start
```

### In Claude Desktop

The `compile_get_errors` tool will automatically use the enhanced service when enabled:

```
unity-mcp-server:compile_get_errors (forceCompile: true)
```

## Benefits

1. **Multiple Detection Methods** - If one method fails, others can still detect errors
2. **Better Error Context** - Shows code context around errors with line highlighting
3. **Compilation Triggering** - Can force Unity to compile when `forceCompile: true`
4. **Result Caching** - Caches results for 5 seconds to improve performance
5. **Cross-Platform Support** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## Error Format

Errors are displayed with enhanced formatting:

```
Found 2 compilation errors
Sources: CompilationHelper, Editor Log

📄 Assets/Scripts/Player/PlayerController.cs
──────────────────────────────────────────────────

❌ ERROR CS0246 (Line 15:13)
   The type or namespace name 'NonExistentType' could not be found

   13:     public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour
   14:     {
>  15:         private NonExistentType myVariable;
   16:         
   17:         void Start()
```

## Testing

To test the enhanced compilation service:

```bash
# Build the project first
npm run build

# Run the test script with your Unity project path
node test-enhanced-compilation.js /path/to/your/unity/project
```

## Troubleshooting

If compilation errors are not being detected:

1. Make sure Unity Editor is open
2. Save all scripts in Unity (Ctrl/Cmd+S)
3. Use `forceCompile: true` to trigger compilation
4. Install the CompilationHelper for best results:
   ```
   unity-mcp-server:compile_install_helper
   ```

## Technical Details

The enhanced service extends the base CompilationService and overrides the `getCompilationErrors` method. It maintains backward compatibility while providing improved error detection capabilities.

Key improvements:
- Parallel error detection from multiple sources
- Duplicate error removal
- Enhanced error context with surrounding code
- Automatic compilation triggering
- Platform-specific log file detection
